## 🌟 What's This All About?

SeattleDoge is a visual love letter to the Emerald City, combining the internet's favorite meme dog with Seattle's iconic vibe. It's an interactive web experience featuring dynamic topographic patterns, smooth gradients, and that perfect PNW aesthetic that hits different.

### ✨ Features That Actually Slap

- 🌈 **Animated Gradients**: Smooth color transitions inspired by Seattle's moody skies
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Looks fire on everything from your phone to your ultrawide monitor
- 🎭 **Hidden Doge**: Check the console for a little ASCII surprise 👀
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast**: Pure vanilla JS, no bloated frameworks
